\subsection{What is a Conjugate Basis Function}

\subsection{Linear Quadratic Learning}

\subsubsection{Example --- Classical LQL [Is this worth it?]}

\subsection{Repurposing LQL for ILC}
%So redefining our functions, all that

\subsubsection{Example --- LQL on the ILC Problem}

\subsection{Conjugate Basis Functions for RL}
%Demonstrate the properties (one at a time matches two, or order doesn't matter)

\subsubsection{Example --- RL with Conjugate Basis Functions}
